# Fluentbot

Sample chat bot to play with telegram API.

## Usage
Put your token in 'token.txt' and start the bot.
The bot recognizes /if command.
For example:
/if * say 'hello' say 'hi, %username',
So people in chat are allowed to teach the bot.
The words 'say' are not necessary, the * symbol means any person.
%username is... 
Nothing really special here, just use anything you need for your needs.

## Testing
Sometimes the bot is available as @FluentBot
